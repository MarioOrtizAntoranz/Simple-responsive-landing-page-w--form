Simple responsive landing page with form

<p>I was asked to create a responsive landing page with a simple form which 
once submitted should take to a sucess page.</p>

<p>Giving focus to the first field of the form had a setback on mobile and tablets so I had to make a little script in JQuery to disable focus based in which device the user was loading the page to disable focus on mobile devices</p>

<p>Technologies used in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>Media queries</li>
<li>Bootstrap 3.0</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<ul>
